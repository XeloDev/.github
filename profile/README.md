# XeloDev

XeloDev is a small, independent development team focused on building high-performance systems, reliable software, and immersive game experiences. We combine low-level system optimization with modern development practices to create efficient, scalable, and user-focused solutions.

## What We Do

### System Development and Optimization
Designing and optimizing operating system tools, performance scripts, and low-level utilities for stability, speed, and efficiency.

### Software Engineering
Developing clean, maintainable, and scalable software solutions across multiple platforms, with a strong focus on performance and usability.

### Game Development
Creating games and interactive experiences that balance technical performance with engaging design and gameplay mechanics.

## Our Philosophy

At XeloDev, we believe that performance matters as much as design, clean code is powerful code, and systems, software, and games should work with the hardware rather than against it. Continuous learning and experimentation drive innovation.

## Technologies and Skills

- Cross-platform software development  
- Game engines and interactive frameworks
